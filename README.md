# vs_pausemenu

Our first release is ready! This pause menu is an innovative resource with a custom NUI that replaces the old and boring GTA V default pause menu. 
Everything is fully customizable from the config.lua file. 
The resource is standalone, so itâ€™s independent from frameworks like ESX or QB. 
Also, the UI is responsive, so you can play with every resolution. 
We hope you enjoy it, and stay tuned for the next releases!

Source code is accessible.
